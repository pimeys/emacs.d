# Emacs-Evil Configuration

This is my Emacs configuration, based on [terhechte's emacs.d](https://github.com/terhechte/emacs.d).

Basically it's Emacs + evil-mode + several selected plugins I've gathered for my work configuration. For color scheme I use solarized-dark and my font is Inconsolata (with powerline extra characters).

I use the configuration mainly for writing Ruby.
