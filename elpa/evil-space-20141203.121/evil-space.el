;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This program emulates vim-space initially developed by Henrik Ã–hman
;; (spiiph) It help you using <SPC> key to repeat the last motion like
;; what the dot <.> key does to repeat the last command. The motion
;; are normally setup in pair, that means the <S-SPC> (or customized
;; to what one needs) to reverse that motion.

;;; Example:
;;
;; After hits <}> to go to next paragraph, hits <SPC> again will move
;; to the next one, while <S-SPC> will move to the previous one.


;;; Code:

(require 'evil)

(defcustom evil-space-next-key (kbd "SPC")
  "Key that triggers the repeat motion."
  :group 'evil-space)
(defcustom evil-space-prev-key (kbd "S-SPC")
  "Key that triggers the repeat motion in reverse direction."
  :group 'evil-space)

;;;###autoload
(defmacro evil-space-setup (key next prev)
  "Setup `evil-space` for motion `key`

`SPC` and `S-SPC` are map to next and prev"
  `(progn
     (when (not (fboundp ',(intern (concat "evil-space-" next))))
       (fset ',(intern (concat "evil-space-" next))
         (symbol-function ',(lookup-key evil-motion-state-map next))))
     (when (not (fboundp ',(intern (concat "evil-space-" next))))
       (fset ',(intern (concat "evil-space-" prev))
         (symbol-function ',(lookup-key evil-motion-state-map prev))))
     (defadvice ,(lookup-key evil-motion-state-map key)
       (before ,(intern (concat (symbol-name (lookup-key evil-motion-state-map key)) "-space")) activate)
       ,(concat "Setup evil-space for motion " key)
       (define-key evil-motion-state-map ,evil-space-next-key ',(intern (concat "evil-space-" next)))
       (define-key evil-motion-state-map ,evil-space-prev-key ',(intern (concat "evil-space-" prev))))))
